# E-Scooter Demand Deck

During the bootcamp, part of the Data Engineering module, we have collected city information, weather information and flight data. The main idea was to enhance this task with predicting E-scooter demand modelling.
This repository explains the final project done as part of Data Science bootcamp at WBS school.
Project Goal: Predicting E-scooter demand based on the previous trips and relevant data like weather data, .
It was done in three parts.

- Data Engineering: Collecting the E-scooter trip data, weather data, public holidays and football games data
- Data Modelling: Used Prophet and multiple models to predict the E-scooter demand
- Data Visualization: Using streamlit presenting the historical data and demand prediction models.
